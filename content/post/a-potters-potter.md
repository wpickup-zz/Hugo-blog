Goldmark have produced another fascinating "day in the life" video, this time featuring French potter Jean-Nicholas Gerard who makes beautiful slipware pots.

Although these videos are obviously produced to promote the artists ahead of upcoming exhibitions at Goldmark, they are in themselves a tremendous service to the ceramics community. The gentle pace and broad scope allow the viewer to be transported into the rhythm of these artists lives.

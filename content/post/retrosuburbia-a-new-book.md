<p><a href="http://permaculture.wikia.com/wiki/David_Holmgren">David Holmgren</a>, the co-founder of Permaculture with Bill Mollison, has a <a href="https://retrosuburbia.com">new book</a> in the works. This one focuses on retrofitting the environments that most of us live in today - the suburbs.I enjoyed this interview with David on the books' promo <a href="https://retrosuburbia.com">website</a>.</p>
